This is a simple module to demonstrate the use of CGI::WML to create a WML 
(wireless) file browser using mod_perl. It was written to accompany an article 
in the Perl Journal #20.

It requires mod_perl and CGI::WML to be installed.

Add the following to 'httpd.conf':

  PerlModule Apache::WAP::AutoIndex
  <Location ~ "filelist\.wml$">
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::WAP::AutoIndex
  </Location>

After installing, access a directory with a WML browser, appending 
"filelist.wml" to view the results.
